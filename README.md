# Text-Based Adventure Game

## Introduction
This is a simple text-based adventure game developed using Python. The game allows players to navigate through different rooms, collect items, and battle monsters. It also incorporates a database approach for storing user data using persistence.

## How to Play
- **Starting Point**: You begin in the start room.
- **Collect Items**: Visit the armory to pick up your armor and weapons.
- **Battle Room**: Enter the battle room to start the game and face monsters.
- **Monster Drops**: Defeated monsters can drop weapons, which you can collect.

## Features
- **Rooms**: Different rooms for starting, collecting items, and battling.
- **Items**: Armor and weapons available for collection.
- **Monsters**: Various monsters to battle, each with the potential to drop items.
- **Persistence**: User data is stored persistently using a database.

## Lessons Learned
- **Python Programming**: Improved skills in Python, particularly in handling game logic and user interactions.
- **Database Integration**: Gained experience in integrating a database to store and manage user data.
- **Game Development**: Learned the fundamentals of game development, including game flow, item management, and enemy interactions.

## Conclusion
This project was a fun and educational experience, allowing me to explore various aspects of game development and data persistence. I look forward to expanding the game with more features and challenges in the future.
